Moreover, you have the option to download my resume or reach out to me via email for any questions.",

        "modal-c": "The project involves developing a C program that utilizes multiple processes and threads to manage communication and data processing. The program consists of two processes: 'MasterWorker' and 'Collector'. 'MasterWorker' is a multi-threaded process that includes a Master thread and a variable number of Worker threads. The Worker threads process binary files containing integers and send the results to the 'Collector' process via AF_LOCAL sockets. The 'Collector' process receives, sorts, and prints the results. The project also requires handling specific signals for the control and orderly termination of the processes.",

        "modal-Java": "The project is a social media platform inspired by STEEMIT, a blockchain-based platform that rewards users for quality content. It employs a client-server architecture to manage content and rewards, simplifying the reward calculation mechanism compared to STEEMIT. Users can publish, vote, and comment on content, receiving rewards in 'wincoin'. The system periodically calculates rewards based on user interaction with the content. Registration, login, and other operations are handled through RMI and TCP. Data persistence is achieved through JSON files."
